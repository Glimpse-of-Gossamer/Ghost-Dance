# Ghost-Dance
A C script that animates dancing ghosts in the terminal.

# Usage
This script was meant to be run through the terminal and accepts up to two different arguments.
The script handles to following cases:
* No arguments: Print out one dancing ghost for 60 seconds
* One argument (integer): Print out that many dancing ghosts for 60 seconds
* Two arguments (integers): Print out that many dancing ghosts for a specified amount of seconds

# Why did I make this?
It was October and I wanted to curb boredom while being festive for Halloween. So basically ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# How to set it up
## Run the following commands:
### For Linux
```
gcc -o ghost Ghosts.c -lm
chmod -x ghost
```
Now just slap this bad-boy where all of your other terminal commands are and you're gucci.
